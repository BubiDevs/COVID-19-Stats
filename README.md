#  COVID-19-Stats

This is a sample SwiftUI project that shows COVID-19 data provided by **Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)**. The official data are available on the official [GiHub repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

The app has two sections:

* Daily report: shows the daily report for a selected date. Is possible to sort by country, deaths or confirmed cases.
* Time series: allows to show the daily evolution for confirmed cases for every single country

## ToDo

### Improvements and features

- [ ] Time series deaths and recovered
- [ ] Better detail view in daily report

### Code side

- [ ] Improve UI with view models or other patterns
- [ ] Find a generic way to handle the flags
